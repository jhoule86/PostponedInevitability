Postponed Inevitability

The idea for this project is a "custom sleep timer" that wants to do something but lets users delay or cancel the action.

I'm currently manually running executable jars for some tasks, and I could schedule those runs, but I want to make something more robust.
I'm aware that I can solve this with a combination of prexisting products, but that's not my goal.
This is an exploratory project intended to involve topics such as these:
* Mulithreading
* Custom user interactions
* Email: SMTP, IMAP
* OAuth for java mail

Some things to do for a POC are:
1. Create an Action of "turn off TV" (using my TV remote framework)
2. Create a Postponement of "Send me an email" (using an email client I haven't written yet)
3. Create a Postponement Answer implementation of "User sent an email back in a timely manner, gave us a new time" (using an email client and email parser I haven't written yet)
